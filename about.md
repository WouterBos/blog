This is a blog with musings on photography. It's not about the technicalities on photography although I might sometimes touch on it. I rather talk about photography as a way of looking at the world, the practicalities of street photography and the relation between photographer and the subject.

This blog is mainly meant to structure my thoughts on photography and in the mean time create a website I can tinker with as I like styling minimal websites.

I hope my articles will bring you value.
